> NFT Folder Animation

Lots of NFT wallets could be nicer. I like to organize files, so I thought I would provide a mock-up that would organize NFTs in your wallet by collection. In this case, [@nounsdao](https://twitter.com/nounsdao) is implemented with NFT creation date and NFT ID. Fist time playing with anime.js library!
